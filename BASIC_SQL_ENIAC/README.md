### **WBS - PROJECT 1: SQL / ENIAC**

This is a project done during my Data Science bootcamp at the *WBS School*. 
We had our first SQL challenges to get comfortable with this language and to make sure everyone got at the same level (See my first codes in *Advanced SQL* file). 

We then started a group project. Working for this company called ENIAC, a spanish company selling high-tech products that want to expand in Brazil. Since the director board is in a hurry, they want the expansion to happen next year, even though the study of the market might take longer. 

ENIAC got in contact with MAGIST, a marketplace that supports small and medium size companies with their deals they benefit. MAGIST sent a sample of their datas and our mission was to go through datas and see if we want to work with them, if MAGIST was an appropriate partner for our expansions.

> In the codes in *ENIAC* file, you will find the basic codes to get to know more about MAGIST.

> In the codes in *BUSINESS QUESTIONS*, you will find some codes to get better insides of MAGIST company.
